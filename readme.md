 [Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering]
 -  Electrical & Computer Engineering
 -  12.0 units
 -  The goals of this freshman engineering course are: - To introduce freshman into the scope and material covered in ECE - To engender enthusiasm for the discipline by seeing real world applications - To invite engineering freshman to find a professional home in ECE - To develop qualitative intuition in prep for quantitative analysis of ECE core  This will be accomplished by taking students through three typical ECE systems that each include analog devices and circuits (18-220), digital logic and computation (18-240) and signal analysis and processing (18-290) and low-level computer programming (18-213). These systems are:  1) An audio processing system: filtering unwanted noise from your music 2) A sensor logic system: making your breadboard react like your smart phone 3) An optical communication system: Transmitting 1s and 0s at the speed of light  The course is experience based and ten labs will take students through the construction and exercise of these systems. Lectures, homework and exams will all focus on developing an understanding needed for success in the labs.
